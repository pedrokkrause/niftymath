# niftymath
Handy optimized math functions

## Usage

If you use a 64-bit Windows and Python 3.12, you may use the already compiled module. If not then open the folder with setup.py and niftymath.pyx in the command prompt and run

`python setup.py build_ext --inplace`

After this, the compiled module will be generated and can be imported in python normally

`import niftymath`

## Current functions

`mul`
Multiplies every number of an iterable.
1.2x faster than pure python implementation.

`ipow`
Calculates x to an integer power n.
x3.4 faster than x\*\*n if x is an int.
x1.8 faster than x\*\*n if x is a float.

`in_polygon`
Checks whether a point is inside a polygon.

`ftan`
Fast approximate tangent calculation for the range |x| < 1.782.
Maximum 0.022% error in the valid range.
Best for x near 0 or near Â±pi/2.
x1.9 faster than math.tan.
